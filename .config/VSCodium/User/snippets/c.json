	// Place your snippets for cpp here. Each snippet is defined under a snippet name and has a prefix, body and 
	// description. The prefix is what is used to trigger the snippet and the body will be expanded and inserted. Possible variables are:
	// $1, $2 for tab stops, $0 for the final cursor position, and ${1:label}, ${2:another} for placeholders. Placeholders with the 
	// same ids are connected.
	// Example:
	"boilerplate": {
		"prefix": "boilerplate code for c",
		"body": [
			"#include<stdio.h>",
			"#include<stdlib.h>",
			"#include<string.h>",
			"\n",
			"\n",
			"\n",
			"int main(){",
			"\n",
			"\t$1",
			"\n",
			"\treturn 0;",
			"}"
		
		],
		"description": "This is boilerplate for c"
	}
